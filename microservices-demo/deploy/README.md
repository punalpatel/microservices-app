# Deployment Configurations

Sub directories contain scripts and configuration for deployment target platforms. Please see the repository listing for an up to date list of deployments.

The intention was to also support the following, but have been held up by technical issues:

- Mesosphere DC/OS (No support in DCOS universe for mutli-container packages)
- Docker Swarmkit (see [the swarmkit readme](./swarmkit)
- Docker Cloud (Does not suit our use case)
